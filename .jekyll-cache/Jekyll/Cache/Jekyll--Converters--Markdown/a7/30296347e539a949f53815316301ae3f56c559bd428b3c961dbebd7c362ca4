I"Ğ<p>Because it was the first time to solve a problem presented in English when studying algorithms, besides the competition, I was a little embarrassed. However the problem was short and the examples were out, so I wasnâ€™t really tired. It was a little hard to figure out the problem by just looking for words that I didnâ€™t knowâ€¦ Well, I think it is okay because I can study English while solving the algorithm problem | á•)à©­*â¾â¾<br />
