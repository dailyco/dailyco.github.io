I"y<p>It was a little hard to understand the problem. I could see and understand the picture of the example, and it didn’t take very long to write the code. As you can see from solving the problem, there is a cute trick hidden in the problem. It’s a tiny trick that gives you the fear of being a complicated problem before you write the code. (*´o`*)<br />
