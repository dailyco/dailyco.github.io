I"‰<p>Difficulty: Hard<br />
The difficulty of this problem was hard, but when I saw the problem, I thought I could solve. So, I challenged it with curiosity, but the result was a little insufficient. It passed 49 of the total 51 test cases. Itâ€™s a little lacking, but I hope you focus on the algorithm. And if you know where my code is wrong, please let me know. Â´â€¢ï»Œâ€¢`<br />
